              <br>
              We may deny your request to inspect your medical information. In some circumstances, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed.<br>
              <br>
              You have the right to request a restriction of your medical information. This means you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your medical information for the purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations. You may also request that any part of your medical information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in your care. Your request must state the specific restriction requested and to whom you want the restriction to apply. We are not required to agree to your request. If we agree to the requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your medical information in violation of that restriction unless it is needed to provide emergency treatment or unless we otherwise notify you that we can no longer honor your request. With this in mind, please discuss any restriction you wish to request with your physician.
